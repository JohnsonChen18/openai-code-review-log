Review of the Code Changes:

**File: .github/workflows/main-remote-jar.yml**

- **Change Description**: The `.github/workflows/main-remote-jar.yml` file has been updated to change the secret variable name from `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` to `WEBHOOK`.
  
- **Analysis**:
  - This change appears to be a renaming of the secret variable within the workflow file.
  - The original variable `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` is likely used for triggering a Discord webhook notification.
  - The new variable `WEBHOOK` might be intended to be more generic, or it could be a typo.
  - It is essential to ensure that the rest of the workflow uses the new variable name consistently.
  - There is no newline at the end of the file in the diff output, which might indicate a formatting issue that should be corrected.

**Recommendation**: 
- Verify that all references to `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` have been updated to `WEBHOOK` throughout the workflow to maintain consistency and avoid any undefined variable errors.
- Ensure the newline issue is corrected to maintain the integrity of the file.

**File: openai-code-review-sdk/src/main/java/plus/gaga/middleware/sdk/OpenAiCodeReview.java**

- **Change Description**: The `OpenAiCodeReview` class within the `openai-code-review-sdk` has been updated to change the environment variable name from `WEBHOOK` to `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` in the Discord initialization.

- **Analysis**:
  - This change corrects the environment variable name used for initializing the Discord object in the `OpenAiCodeReview` class.
  - The original code used `getEnv("WEBHOOK")`, which could have led to a lookup for an undefined environment variable if `WEBHOOK` was not set or intended for a different purpose.
  - The corrected code uses `getEnv("DISCORD_WEBHOOK")`, which matches the name used in the workflow file and is more descriptive of its intended use.

**Recommendation**:
- Ensure that the environment variable `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` is correctly set and has the appropriate value in the environment where the application is deployed.
- The change is appropriate and should resolve any issues related to incorrect environment variable names.
