### Code Review for `OpenAiCodeReview.java` and `OpenAiCodeReviewService.java`

#### OpenAiCodeReview.java

**Changes:**
- The `WeiXin` object creation has been commented out and replaced with a null check before its usage.
- The `Discord` object creation uses a hardcoded webhook URL instead of fetching it from environment variables.

**Review:**

1. **Commenting Out Code:** The commented-out code for `WeiXin` object creation is a red flag. It's unclear why this code was commented out and what the intended behavior was. If this is a temporary fix or a placeholder for future removal, it should be documented properly.
   
2. **Hardcoded Discord Webhook URL:** Using a hardcoded webhook URL for the `Discord` object is not a good practice. It reduces flexibility and makes the code harder to maintain. The webhook URL should be fetched from environment variables to allow for easier configuration and changes.

3. **Null Check for WeiXin:** The commented-out code for `WeiXin` object creation has been replaced with a null check before its usage. This might be an oversight if `WeiXin` should be initialized in the constructor. It's important to ensure that `WeiXin` is properly initialized and can handle null values appropriately.

#### OpenAiCodeReviewService.java

**Changes:**
- The `weiXin` object is now nullable, and there's a null check before sending a template message.

**Review:**

1. **Null Check for WeiXin:** The null check before sending a template message is a good practice to prevent `NullPointerException`. However, if `weiXin` is nullable, it should be initialized to a default instance that doesn't send any messages if `weiXin` is `null`.

2. **Documentation:** There's no documentation explaining the purpose of the `weiXin` object or its responsibilities. Adding inline comments or a JavaDoc would help clarify its usage.

3. **Error Handling:** The code assumes that `weiXin` and `discord` are properly configured and initialized. If they are not, the application may fail silently. It's important to add proper error handling and logging to inform the user or system administrator of any issues.

### Conclusion

The changes made to the `OpenAiCodeReview.java` and `OpenAiCodeReviewService.java` files introduce potential issues with code maintainability and error handling. It's crucial to ensure that all objects are properly initialized, and environment variables are used for configuration. Adding comments, documentation, and error handling would greatly improve the robustness and maintainability of the code.
