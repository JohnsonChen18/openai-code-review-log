Review of the `.github/workflows/main-maven-jar.yml` and `OpenAiCodeReview.java` Changes:

**.github/workflows/main-maven-jar.yml**

- **Commit**: c7376bd introduces an environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` into the job that runs the `java -jar ./libs/openai-code-review-sdk-1.0.jar` command.

**Analysis**:
- This change enhances security by ensuring that the GitHub token is used securely when the code review SDK is executed. The token is fetched from GitHub's secrets, which is a best practice to avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the workflow file.

**Recommendations**:
- Ensure that the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret is correctly set in the GitHub repository settings, and it has the appropriate permissions for the workflow to run.
- Verify that the rest of the workflow does not inadvertently expose the `GITHUB_TOKEN` or any other sensitive information.

**OpenAiCodeReview.java**

- **Commit**: 662e149 updates the `OpenAiCodeReview` class to use the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for logging purposes.

**Analysis**:
- The class now retrieves the GitHub token from the environment variable and checks if it is null or empty. If the token is missing, it throws a `RuntimeException`, which is a good practice for handling missing configuration.
- The `writeLog` method has been updated to accept the token as a parameter, which implies that the log writing functionality may need to be adjusted to use the token for authentication or to include it in the log for auditing purposes.

**Recommendations**:
- Confirm that the `writeLog` method has been updated to handle the `GITHUB_TOKEN` appropriately, especially if it's being used for authentication with external services.
- Consider whether the log output should include the token or any other sensitive information, and ensure that logs are stored and transmitted securely.
- Ensure that the token is not logged or exposed in any way that could lead to security vulnerabilities.

Overall, the changes appear to improve the security and robustness of the code review process by using environment variables and handling sensitive information more securely. However, further checks should be made to ensure that the implementation details are correctly handling the new configurations.
