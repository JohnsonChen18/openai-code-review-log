Review of Code Changes in `OpenAiCodeReview.java` and `ApiTest.java`:

**OpenAiCodeReview.java:**

The changes in `OpenAiCodeReview.java` involve the modification of the `sendWeChatMessage` method within the `OpenAiCodeReview` class. Here are the specific points of review:

1. **Removal of `setTouser` Method Call:**
   - The line `-+        message.setTouser("o7buW6kZ0eEWjuqVzxJomn-SeiuQ");` has been removed. This could be a conscious decision if the `setTouser` parameter is no longer required or if there has been a change in the message template requirements. It would be important to verify that this change does not break the functionality if `setTouser` is critical for the message's delivery.

2. **URL Formatting:**
   - The `String url = String.format("https://api.weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/message/template/send?access_token=%s", accessToken);` line is unchanged, which suggests that the URL structure remains the same. This is good practice as it avoids unnecessary changes that could introduce bugs.

3. **No Error Handling:**
   - The code snippet does not include any error handling around the `sendPostRequest` call. It would be beneficial to add try-catch blocks or use a reactive approach to handle potential exceptions that could occur during the HTTP request.

**ApiTest.java:**

The changes in `ApiTest.java` pertain to the `ApiTest` class and involve the addition of a test method for WeChat message sending:

1. **Addition of Test Method:**
   - A new test method `test_wx()` has been added. This method retrieves an access token, creates a `Message` object, and sends a POST request to the WeChat API. This is a positive addition as it provides a way to test the functionality of sending WeChat messages.

2. **Redundant Comments:**
   - The commented-out test method `test_wx()` and its associated code have been removed. This is good practice as it keeps the codebase clean and focused on the current functionality.

3. **No Error Handling:**
   - Similar to `OpenAiCodeReview.java`, there is no error handling in the `sendPostRequest` method. It would be advisable to add error handling to ensure the test is robust and can handle exceptions gracefully.

**Overall Review:**

The changes seem to be focused on removing or updating the code related to sending WeChat messages. While the removal of the `setTouser` parameter might be a mistake if it's still needed, the overall changes are minor and do not introduce new functionality. It is important to ensure that the changes do not affect the existing functionality and that appropriate error handling is added to both the production and test code to improve reliability.
