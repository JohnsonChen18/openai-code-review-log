Review of the Code Changes:

The `OpenAiCodeReview` class has undergone several modifications in the latest commit. Below is a detailed review of the changes:

1. **Method Calls and Variable Renaming:**
   - The method `codeReview` is called twice in the original code (`diffCode.toString()`) and once in the updated code (`diffCode.toString()`). This suggests that the method is being used to review the code, and the output is being printed. The variable name has been changed from `logUrl` to `log` in the updated code, which could be a typo or an attempt to streamline the variable names. This change should be reviewed to ensure that it does not affect the functionality.
   - Similarly, the method `writeLog` is also called twice, and the variable name has been changed from `log` to `logUrl`. This change should be reviewed to ensure consistency and correctness.

2. **Print Statements:**
   - The `System.out.println` statements have been updated to reflect the new variable names. The messages have been changed from "Code review" to "code review：" and "write log" to "writeLog：" in the updated code. This change is minor and likely a language translation from English to Chinese or vice versa. Ensure that this change aligns with the project's requirements and documentation.

3. **Method `pushMessage`:**
   - The method `pushMessage` now takes `logUrl` as an argument instead of `log`. This change could be due to the update in variable names or to pass the URL of the log to the method. The method body is unchanged, but this change should be reviewed to ensure that it does not lead to any unintended behavior or loss of functionality.

4. **General Observations:**
   - The code does not show the implementation details of the `codeReview` and `writeLog` methods. It is important to review these methods to ensure that they are performing the intended operations.
   - The code assumes that the `diffCode` variable is a valid object and that the `toString()` method is correctly implemented. It is important to verify that this is the case.
   - The changes in variable names and method calls should be reviewed for consistency and to ensure that there are no side effects on the rest of the codebase.

Overall, the changes seem to be minor and may be related to language translation or code cleanup. However, a thorough review of the `codeReview` and `writeLog` methods is necessary to ensure that the functionality has not been inadvertently altered.
