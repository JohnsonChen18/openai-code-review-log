Review of the `.github/workflows/main-remote-jar.yml` Code Changes:

The provided diff shows modifications to the GitHub Actions workflow file for a project. Here are the key points and suggestions for improvement:

1. **New Secret Usage**:
   - The addition of `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` as a new secret is a good practice for handling sensitive information. This allows for the configuration of Discord webhook notifications without exposing the webhook URL in the codebase.

2. **Comment Documentation**:
   - The comments before and after the new `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` secret are well-documented, explaining the purpose and usage of the secret. This is helpful for other developers or maintainers who may not be familiar with the codebase.

3. **Consistency in Secret Usage**:
   - The use of `secrets.CHATGLM_APIKEYSECRET` is consistent with the pattern of using the `secrets.<secret_name>` syntax. This pattern should be maintained for the new secret `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` as well to keep the workflow consistent and easy to understand.

4. **No New Job or Step**:
   - The addition of `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` does not appear to be associated with a new job or step in the workflow. It is important to ensure that this secret is used within an action that actually sends a notification to Discord. If this is intended to trigger a notification on certain conditions, the workflow should be updated to include an action that uses this secret.

5. **Secret Management**:
   - It is crucial to manage secrets securely. Make sure that the `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` secret is created in the GitHub repository's secret management system and that the necessary permissions are in place for the workflow to access it.

6. **Workflow Validation**:
   - After making changes to a workflow file, it is essential to validate the workflow to ensure that there are no syntax errors and that the workflow behaves as expected.

Suggested Action:
- If the intention is to use the `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` secret to trigger notifications on certain events, update the workflow to include a job or step that uses this secret with an appropriate action (e.g., sending a message to Discord).
- Ensure that all secrets are properly managed and that the workflow has the necessary permissions to access them.

Overall, the change to add the `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` secret is a positive step in managing sensitive configuration details. However, further updates are required to leverage this new configuration effectively within the workflow.
