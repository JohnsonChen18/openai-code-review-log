Review of the `.github/workflows/main-maven-jar.yml` workflow file changes:

**Changes Overview:**
- The workflow now includes additional steps to capture and export environment variables for the repository name, branch name, commit author, and commit message.
- The workflow also includes a step to print these environment variables for verification.

**Detailed Review:**

1. **Environment Variables Capture:**
   - The addition of steps to capture repository, branch, commit author, and message is a good practice. It allows for better tracking and context when running jobs within the workflow.
   - The use of `GITHUB_ENV` is appropriate for setting environment variables that will be available to all subsequent jobs in the workflow.

2. **Step Definitions:**
   - Each step for capturing information (repo-name, branch-name, commit-author, commit-message) is clearly defined with a descriptive name, making it easy to understand the purpose of each step.
   - The use of `echo` to output the variables into `$GITHUB_ENV` is straightforward and effective.

3. **Print Environment Variables:**
   - The step to print the captured environment variables is useful for debugging and ensuring that the workflow is setting the environment variables correctly.
   - The use of environment variable references within the `echo` commands (e.g., `${{ env.REPO_NAME }}`) is correct and will display the values set in the previous steps.

4. **Job Execution:**
   - The `Run Code Review` step is straightforward and continues to execute the Java JAR from the `libs` directory.
   - The `env` section is missing from the `Run Code Review` step. If there are any environment variables required by the JAR or its dependencies, they should be included in this step.

5. **Best Practices:**
   - It's a good idea to validate the format of the commit author and message captured to ensure they are in a consistent format that can be easily parsed if needed in subsequent steps.
   - Consider adding error handling around the `git log` commands to handle cases where there might be no commits or the repository is not in a git repository.

**Overall:**
The changes in the `.github/workflows/main-maven-jar.yml` file add valuable context and traceability to the workflow by capturing and using environment variables. The workflow is clear and follows best practices for setting environment variables in GitHub Actions. The only potential improvement is to ensure that any required environment variables are passed to the `Run Code Review` step.
