### Code Review for `OpenAiCodeReview.java`

**File:** `openai-code-review-sdk/src/main/java/plus/gaga/middleware/sdk/OpenAiCodeReview.java`

**Changes:**
- **Line 72:** There has been a change in how the message string is constructed before being sent to Discord.

**Review Comments:**

1. **Security Concern:** The hardcoded Discord webhook URL (`webhookUrl`) presents a security risk. It's visible in the source code and could be accidentally exposed if the code is shared or stored in a public repository. Consider using environment variables or a secure configuration management system to store sensitive information.

2. **String Construction:** The original message string was a static test message. The updated code now appends a `logUrl` to the message. This is a good change as it makes the message dynamic and more useful for code review purposes. However, ensure that `logUrl` is always a valid URL and that its construction does not introduce any vulnerabilities or errors.

3. **Exception Handling:** The catch block is printing the stack trace, which is generally not a good practice for production code as it can expose sensitive information and make the logs difficult to read. Consider logging the exception with a more user-friendly message or handling specific exceptions that you expect could occur.

**Suggested Improvements:**

- **Use Constants:** For the message template, consider defining it as a constant if it's not going to change often. This makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.
  
  ```java
  private static final String MESSAGE_TEMPLATE = "This is the new code review: %s";
  // Usage
  String message = String.format(MESSAGE_TEMPLATE, logUrl);
  ```

- **Validate Inputs:** Before sending the message to Discord, validate the inputs (`webhookUrl` and `logUrl`) to ensure they are not null or empty. This will prevent runtime errors.

- **Logging:** Implement proper logging instead of `e.printStackTrace()`. This could be a simple log statement indicating that an error occurred while sending the message to Discord.

- **Unit Testing:** With the change in behavior, it's a good opportunity to add or update unit tests to cover the new functionality and ensure that the message is constructed and sent correctly.

Remember to review the entire context of the code, including related methods like `sendToDiscord`, to ensure that the changes are consistent with the overall design and functionality of the `OpenAiCodeReview` class.
