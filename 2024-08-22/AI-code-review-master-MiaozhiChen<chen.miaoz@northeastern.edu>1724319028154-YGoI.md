Review of the `.github/workflows/main-maven-jar.yml` GitHub Actions workflow file:

**Overall Comments:**
- The workflow file seems to be designed for a Maven project that builds a JAR file and may be using Git commit information for some action or logging.
- The workflow includes steps to get the commit author and message, which could be used for customizing the build or logging purposes.

**Specific Code Review:**

1. **Commit Author Extraction:**
   - The `Get commit author` step is using `git log -1` to fetch the last commit author and email.
   - The `--pretty=format:'%an <%ae>'` argument is correctly formatted to include both the author name and email.
   - The `| tr -d ' '` line removes spaces from the output, which might be unnecessary since the format string does not inherently include spaces. This could be removed unless there's a specific requirement to strip spaces for some reason.
   - **Suggestion:** Consider removing the `| tr -d ' '` line unless it serves a specific purpose.

2. **Commit Message Extraction:**
   - The `Get commit message` step is not shown in the diff. It would be helpful to review this step as well to ensure that the commit message is being extracted correctly and used appropriately.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Environment Variables:**
  - The `COMMIT_AUTHOR` environment variable is being set with the author name and email. This is good practice as it separates configuration from the workflow script.
  - Ensure that other required environment variables are also being set as needed for the workflow.

- **Documentation:**
  - The workflow could benefit from comments explaining the purpose of each step. This would make it easier for others (or future you) to understand the workflow's intent.

- **Version Control:**
  - It's good to see that the workflow file is under version control, which allows for changes and improvements to be tracked and reviewed.

**Conclusion:**
The code review highlights a potential unnecessary step and suggests ensuring that all required environment variables are set. Otherwise, the workflow appears to be well-structured for its intended use case.
